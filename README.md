Let me introduce you to this new design trend of glassmorphism. After last year's neumorphism design trend, which was a controversial style and lacked accessibility, this trend seems a lot more promising.  What is glassmorphism? Essentially, the main aspect of this trend is a semi-transparent background, with a sublime shadow and border.  But you also have a blur added to the background itself so that whatever is behind the background is beautifully "morphed" into the element itself. Does that make sense?  Here's an example:  Glassmorphism  This is a real world example of glassmorphism in action, which you can also check out on the ui.glass website (it's an upcoming CSS UI library).  The blur effect that I've been talking about is what you can see behind the code on the right side of the above image. See how beautifully it morphs into the background, but at the same time still remains readable and pleasing to the eye?  This is the effect that I want to show you how to create in this tutorial. We'll see how to apply it using only HTML and CSS.
